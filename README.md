# hygm-via-claims
contains utility scripts to streamline certificate issuance for volunteers of hey you got mail

- each certificate is assigned a unique SHA-256 hash based on the attributes of the claim (volunteers name, date of claim, activity claimed for, hours claimed, etc.)
- scripts are deployed internally via AppsScript and Google Colab for use by members of heyyougotmail.com

These scripts have been used to process over 400 Hours worth of Volunteer work
